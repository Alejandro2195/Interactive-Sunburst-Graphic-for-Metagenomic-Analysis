# Interactive Sunburst Graphic for Metagenomic Analysis

This repository contains code for generating a sunburst graphic for metagenomic analysis. The code reads a CSV file using the read.csv() function, allowing users to select the file interactively. The CSV file should be formatted with semicolon (;) as the delimiter and without header information.

Once the data is loaded, the code utilizes the sunburst() function to create an interactive sunburst graphic. The count parameter is set to TRUE to display the count of each category in the sunburst graphic.

This repository provides a convenient and customizable tool for visualizing metagenomic data using a sunburst graphic, enabling researchers to gain insights into the hierarchical structure and composition of microbial communities.

Note: It is recommended to ensure that the required packages and dependencies are installed before running the code.
